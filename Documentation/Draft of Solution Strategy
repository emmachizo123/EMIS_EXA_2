This is a documentation of how I intend to approach this project time permitting.
This is a list of "tickets"

Set up vitual  Environment:
Create a Python virtual environment using virtual env or venv
Activate the virtual environment

Install Dependencies:
Use pip to install necessary Python Packages and libaries such us fhir.resources

Design data transformation pipeline:
Design a pipeline to transform FHIR messages into a tabular format
Use Python libararies like pandas or pyspark for data manipulation and transformation

Secure Data Reading in Docker Container:
Store sensitive credentials in environment variables
Use a secure file management approach toread data within the Docker container
implement access control mechanisms to restrict access to data files

Containerise the Pipeline:
Write a docker fileto containerise the data transformation piple line
include necessary configurations and dependencies in the Docker image
Ensure the Docker container is isolated and properly configured for production use

Implement Testing:
write unit test to validate the functionality of individual components.
Write integration test to ensure the pipeline works as expected end-to-end
Use testing frameowrk like pytest or unittest for testing


Documentation
Provide detail documentation on how to install and run the solutiob
Explain how touse the result generated by the pipeline
Document the Architecture of the solution, including data flow and the components.
Include next steps for further development and improvement

Adhere to Best Practices
Follow standard coding practices for the chose programming language
Ensure code readability, maintanability, and scalability
Use meaninful variable names, modulaise code and adhere to coding style guidline
